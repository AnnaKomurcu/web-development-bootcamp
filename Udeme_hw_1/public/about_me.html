    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>My name is Anna. I live in Malta, and I love everything related to creativity. Right now, Iâ€™m learning HTML and CSS, exploring web design, and aiming to grow in this field. Iâ€™m still a beginner, but I enjoy the process of creating something new. Iâ€™m also studying the Maltese languageâ€”itâ€™s interesting and helps me better understand the local culture.</p>

    <p>I dream of making my apartment cozy and beautiful, reflecting my mood and style. I enjoy experimenting with design and coming up with new ideas for my space. I believe that everything Iâ€™ve planned will come true because Iâ€™m moving toward my goals with confidence and inspiration. ðŸ˜Š</p>
